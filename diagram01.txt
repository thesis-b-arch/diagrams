1879 - Thomas Edison produces electric light bulb
1760-1830 - first industrial revolution - new manufacturing processes (from hand to machine), steam power, machine tools, factory system, efficient iron production processes.
1850 - second industrial revolution - electrification, hydroelectric power, chemical industries, etc. 
industrial revolution benefits - increased wealth for all, raised life expectancy, reduced working hours, children and elderly don't have to work. First time in history where there's a simultaneous increase in population and per capita income. All examples of how new technologies quickly snuffed out the older methods and proved to be significantly better.
